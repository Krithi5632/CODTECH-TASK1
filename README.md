Project: DIGITAL LOGIC DESIGN WITH VERILOG

OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Objective:
Design and simulate basic digital logic circuits using Verilog within a VLSI software environment, ensuring correct functionality and analyzing simulation results.

Key Activities:
1. Design digital logic circuits: Create Verilog designs for basic digital logic circuits, such as logic gates, adders, and multiplexers.
2. Write Verilog code: Write synthesizable Verilog code for each digital logic circuit.
3. Simulate Verilog designs: Simulate the Verilog designs using a VLSI software simulator.
4. Analyze simulation results: Use the waveform viewer in the VLSI software to analyze the simulation results and verify correct functionality.
5. Debug and refine designs: Debug and refine the Verilog designs as needed to ensure correct functionality.


Technologies Used:
1. Verilog: A hardware description language (HDL) used for designing digital logic circuits.
2. VLSI software: A software environment for designing, simulating, and analyzing digital logic circuits, such as ModelSim, QuestaSim, or Vivado.
3. Waveform viewer: A tool within the VLSI software for visualizing and analyzing simulation results.
4. Digital logic circuit design: The process of designing digital logic circuits using Verilog and VLSI software.
